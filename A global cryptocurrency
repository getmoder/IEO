When Getmoder launched in May 2018, it introduced GTMR (amounted 251 million tokens), a cryptocurrency that allows users to apply for crypto loan at a discounted rate with us. Getmoder was the first of many use cases where GTMR has driven Getmoder’s global ecosystem growth. Since its inception, Getmoder has decided to increasingly developed its functions and use cases, and intends to expand  its role as one of the most widely-used utility tokens in the blockchain space. GTMR is a cryptocurrency token and operates on the Ethereum platform.

GTMR is now intended to be at the forefront of many applications driving further crypto adoption. We will collaborate with blockchain and non-blockchain companies to expand GTMR’s use case:

- Apply for crypto loan (our main core business). Immediate approval. Flexible repayments. Automatic approval, no credit checks. 

- Merchant payments with GTMR. People will be able to pay for goods and services in GTMR via various merchant POS systems around the world.

- Traveling with GTMR. People will be able to use GTMR to pay for hotels and flight bookings.

- Buying virtual gifts. People will be able use GTMR to pay for virtual gifts on certain partners websites

- Buying property. Pay for real estate assets using GTMR on certain property listing websites.

Understanding GTMR

Now that we’ve identified the many ways you can use GTMR , here’s a quick breakdown of what you need to know about this powerful utility token.

a) GTMR is a fully operational asset that can function as a currency (storage of value for global usage)  and a medium of exchange. Whether you use it to apply for our inhouse crypto loan,  pay for goods, to spend on exchange fees, or to trade for USD and many other fiat and cryptocurrencies, GTMR is an asset you can use, spend, and store easily, with wide acceptance that can rival some of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world. 

b) GTMR is decentralized and its direction is not controlled by the Getmoder team.

c) GTMR is not an investment. It does not represent equity in Getmoder. Holding GMTR only allows you to pay for services offered within and outside of the Getmoder ecosystem, not to have a stake in Getmoder.
